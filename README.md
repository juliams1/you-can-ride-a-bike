# you-can't-ride-a-bike

Hello! This project was made with my basic learning of SwiftUI, its so fun!

How you can see i didn't learn as a child how to ride a bike, in Brazil we have a singer called "Ludmilla" 
and she told on a interview that her biggest fear was "cair de moto e se ralar" that in english is "fall of a motorbike and get bruised".

I know that motorbikes are far more fast than an actual bike but MY FEAR IS REAL!

So this app is my supportive action for those who can't ride a bike.

Hope you like it (:
